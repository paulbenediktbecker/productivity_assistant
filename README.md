# Setup 
In order to include Pictures into the fetching process, we need access to the Notion API to fetch these.


1. You need to have a Notion page that contains all pages, in which you want to search for 
2. generate a Notion API Key as described under point "Step 1: Create an integration." [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started)
3. Share the page you created in step 1 as desribed under point "Step 2: Share a database with your integration" [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started)
4. Setup secret.py as described in Assistant.py 
6. Install the AnkiConnect AddOn to Anki as described [here](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/)

# Rules to make this script work 
1. You need to have a Notion page that contains all pages, in which you want to search for toggles 
2. The page of point 1 must contain toggles which are not nested in any other block. Otherwise we wont find them. 

Your structure should look like this:

In this case, "Semester 5" is the page refered to, in point 1. <br>
The Page "IT-Security" is one example of a page that can be fetched.<br>
On the right you see that "IT-Security" contains non-nested toggles.

3. Anki has to be open during use of the script (due to AnkiConnect)
